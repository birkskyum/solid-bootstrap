# Solid Bootstrap Core

> Ported from [restart/ui](https://react-restart.github.io/ui/) 

Solid Bootstrap Core is a set of full featured, extensible, and accessible UI components, designed to integrate into any styling
framework or system. Core components, are "headless", meaning they don't provide any styles. Components encapsulate
the complicated logic and and state without being prescriptive about their look and feel.

## Installation

```js
npm install solid-bootstrap-core
```

## Styling

Core components are "headless", meaning each component encapsulates logic and markup but not styling.
These components ares intended as a basis for building design systems using which styling technology you like.
You should provide your own styles, and the documentation provides some simple examples
for how to do that. For more complex integrations, check out the [Solid Bootstrap components](https://solid-libs.github.io/solid-bootstrap/components/accordion).

There are a few places where inline `style`s are applied, however. They are functionally
required and very minimal. Specifically `PopperJs` injects it's own styles in order
to position overlays and dropdowns, and `Modal` applies `overflow: hidden` to the
document body. These can technically be overridden but you probably won't need to.
